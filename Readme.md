AeroSphinx – Surface-Level PM2.5 Estimation & Forecasting
AeroSphinx is a project developed for ISRO’s Bhartiya Antariksha Hackathon (BAH 25).
It focuses on estimating and forecasting surface-level PM2.5 concentrations in Faridabad using:

Satellite data (INSAT AOD)
Ground monitoring data (CPCB)
Reanalysis data (MERRA-2)
🔹 Features
Data preprocessing and integration from heterogeneous sources
Machine learning pipeline for PM2.5 estimation
Short-term forecasting models
Interactive dashboard for real-time visualization
🔹 Tech Stack
Python: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib
Visualization: PowerBI
Data Sources: INSAT AOD, CPCB, MERRA-2
🔹 Additional Insights
1. Feature Engineering
We engineered two additional features:

Temperature Difference
Humidity Ratio
These were introduced to capture more accurate trends of how temperature and humidity influence PM2.5 levels. Rising temperatures often cause water droplets to settle along with pollutants, thereby reducing concentrations. Conversely, higher humidity tends to increase PM2.5 concentrations, making these features critical for improved predictions.

2. Forecast Horizon
Our forecasting model is currently designed for a one-day horizon. Specifically, it predicts PM2.5 concentrations around 5:00 PM each evening. For this phase of the project, we focused only on short-term forecasting to ensure robust evaluation of our pipeline.

3. Seasonality Trends
Clear seasonality trends were observed:

Winter (around November): PM2.5 levels increase significantly
Monsoon season: Concentrations reach their minimum
These seasonal variations highlight the influence of meteorological conditions on air quality and align with real-world environmental observations.
